// The MoveFinder methods have to be of the following format:

// Input: A piece, A game.

// Output: The coordinates that this piece can move to.

// In order to do so, it should:

// 1). Find all movable squares for this piece, self checking or not.
// 2). Find all movable squares for all pieces of the enemy player, self checking or not.
// 3). Remove all self checking moves for this piece, to obtain all legal moves.

// It then returns a list/set of coordinates.

// So, instead of adding the movable coordinates to the piece attribute, a return list should be passed
// into the function as an argument. Then, the movable squares can be added to that list before it is returned.
// Note: We should have a separate list for the legal movable squares, since we don't want to remove elemnts from
// a data structure while we are iterating over it. So , the movable squares array is only a temporary element.
// The list that is actually returned is only ever the LegalMovableSquares.
